This project uses supervised machine learning to predict crop yield categories — Low, Medium, or High — based on soil, rainfall, and seed type data. It demonstrates how classification models can support agricultural decision-making using basic AI techniques.

Objectives
Load and preprocess the dataset

Encode categorical features

Train a Random Forest Classifier

Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, and recall

Visualize the confusion matrix using a heatmap

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Google Colab

 Evaluation Metrics


Accuracy – Measures overall correctness of predictions

Precision – Measures how many predicted categories were correct

Recall – Measures how well the model identified each category

Confusion Matrix – Heatmap visualization of actual vs. predicted classes

 Output Summary


The model was trained using the Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation metrics showed good prediction performance

A heatmap of the confusion matrix helped in interpreting model behavior

 Conclusion

This project shows how machine learning can be applied in agriculture to predict crop yield levels. It provides a simple and practical example of AI helping farmers and researchers in making data-driven decisions.
